Project Goals

- To create a well documented "core" for the application
- To employ a "fluent" api philosophy allowing for readable code
- To allow loading of *signed* .dll 'modules' for expanded game support
- To allow users to define rules to set up modding for **most** games

Non-goals
- To re-invent the mod manager with overly complex tools, such as virtual file systems, etc.
We just want to be able to see what's installed, and uninstall it if we wish, and check for updates
- To immediately support hugely modded games, such as Minecraft or Gamebryo based games, this is already done very well.

Potential additions in the future
- FOmod and Omod support, featuring installation gui, etc.
