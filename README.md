# Candor-Redux
Candor Redux, made with c# for speed and deeper OS intergration

# Why a Redux?
CandorModManager was my first major project that I released, and we'll, it became spaghetti after I tried adding too much too quickly, without foresight.

This made it extremely hard to maintain or change systems without major internal changes.

Starting from scratch with a limited scope and with expandability in mind, will enable me to maintain and enhance to project long term. 

By splitting the project in to a "Core", "UI" and "API" will allow this project to evolve without the need for complicated set up.

# What games will be supported first?
At present I plan on supporting Baldurs Gate 3 and The Sims 4, as those are the two games I originally created candor for, when it was just for myself.

I'd also like to add support for the Dragon Age games and even Cyberpunk 2077 although we first need a working application

# Can I help?
Absolutely! 

Once I have the project structure set up, feel free to open issues for any feedback/suggestions you may have.
